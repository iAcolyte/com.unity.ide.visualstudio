# Fork of com.unity.ide.visualstudio

Add advanced filters aiming to improve the developer experience when working with Visual Studio and Unity.

## Nullable
Add Nullable feature. Create `csc.rsp` file at the same folder as your `.asmdef`, with content:
```
-nullable:enable
```
Regenerate project files

## Rationale
The more packages or assembly definitions you have in your project the more sluggish your Visual Studio experience becomes.
This is most notably on startup but also when attaching Visual Studio to e.g. trigger break points.

With this fork you can select exactly what source code you want to be able to see (and step through and debug) in visual studio and reduce the generated vs projects to just the few you actually need:

Consider this simplified example:

turns into:

By that you're able to remove all those projects from your Visual Studio solution you'd never look at anyway or even edit.

## Installation
Here are the easiest ways to install the package, choose either:

### A) Using package manager
Open Package Manager, select "Add package from git URL..." and enter
```
https://github.com/krisrok/com.unity.ide.visualstudio.git#2.0.21-advanced_package_filter
```

### B) Edit manifest
Replace the original package with this fork inside the `manifest.json`:

In the dependencies find the line 

```
"com.unity.ide.visualstudio": "2.0.21",
```

and replace it with

```
"com.unity.ide.visualstudio": "https://github.com/krisrok/com.unity.ide.visualstudio.git#2.0.21-advanced_package_filter",
```

Also works for 2.0.20, 2.0.18, 2.0.17 and 2.0.16 (but not 2.0.19).

## Usage

1. Navigate to Edit/Preferences/External Tools.
2. Use the the pre-existing filters to choose between embedded, local packages and so on. (Note this functionality is already provided by Unity's original package.)
3. Now, for finer-grained control you can open the the "Advanced Filters" foldout:
4. Select which packages and assemblies (defined by .asmdefs) you actually want in your solution. Tip: You can also use Ctrl/Shift to add/remove checkmarks in bulk while moving your cursor over them.
5. Click "Regenerate project files" to make sure changes are applied.
6. Open Visual Studio e.g. by opening a script. If the solution is already open Visual Studio should display a dialog to automatically re-open it.

## Note
This is a fork of a mirror package because Unity does not provide public access to the original sources.
